						Early
					</h3>

					<p class="background" style="background-color: black;">
						I am native to Georgia. I was a quiet kid but the teachers thought differently as they always said in my progress reports. I attended three elementary school in the Atlanta Area. I was fortunate to test subject in my parents life as they produced a well rounded young man that is before you today. Going into middle school I knew what it was that I wanted to major in and what schools I wanted to apply for. I was on my way. It was during this time of my life also that I become more active in school activities. I ran track and was an active tutor for my teachers after school assisting in the lesson of the day to my peers who were not as clear on the topic. Going into High School I was prepared to tackle all things related to academics and extracurricular activites. I was part of the almost all sports teams atleast once. Track, Baskteball, Football, Soccer, Baseball, Cross Country, and Rifle Team. I enjoyed being a part of every team and it by far gave me discipline that sculted my demeanor. In wrapping up I enjoyed two years of college and worked as a cook for a while before starting Year Up and gaining a position at GameStop.

						Current
					</h3>

					<p class="background" style="background-color: black;">
						Currently I am looking to be hired on as a part of the IT Team in the automation world. I have been a great help Marketing, QA, and Development teams over the past 8 years. My skills are in many forms of programming languages, organizational skills, and testing. I love what I do and there is always something new to learn when it comes to getting better at what I love.
						I enjoy a lot of other things in my spare time and some how make more than 24 hours in my day to accomodate all the hobbies I have. I enjoy volunteering my time to people who want to grow in programming and sports. I volunteer my time on Saturdays coaching a basketball team for my church. I have organized a top 5 team in the league and have a goal to get the team to the top 3 next season.
						I love the outdoors, rpgs, fps, strategy games, animated movies, and just being in good company. I read psychology book in as an on going hobby as well to gain a better understanding of what others might be thinking or how they are prone to think. It is relaxing and thought provoking at the same time.
